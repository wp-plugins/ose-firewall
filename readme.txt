== Frequently asked questions ==

= What to do if i have a problem? =
* You can disable the plugin by renaming the file /wp-content/plugins/ose-firewall/ose_wordpress_firewall.php to /wp-content/plugins/ose-firewall/ose_wordpress_firewall_bk.php, or 
* You can always visit our <a href = "https://www.centrora.com/support-center/">support center</a> to raise a ticket, and we will assign an expert to fix your problem immediately.

= I get a Fatal Error: 'Class PDO not found'? =
* If you encounter the error 'Fatal error: Class 'PDO' not found' when the Centrora Security is activated, this indicates the PHP Data Objects is not loaded in your PHP environment. PDO is activated by default as of PHP 5.1.0, so please contact your hosting company to enable it if it is disabled. If you know how to customize the php configuration, add these codes into... <a href = "http://www.centrora.com/user-manual/application-runtime-path-valid/">Learn more</a>.

= Application runtime path not valid? =
* If you are getting this error, you have to change the permission for both of these folders and set them writable. <a href = "http://www.centrora.com/user-manual/application-runtime-path-valid/">Learn more</a>.

= Does the plugin block User Agent attacks? =
* Yes, the plugin checks whether the user agent environment variables contains PHP command, linux system commands and sql commands. If these are detected, the firewall will stop the user by throwing a ban page. 

= What is DFI or LFI? =
* DFI or LFI refers to Direct (Local) File Inclusion, where it usually comes with the user agent attacks. Hackers first test if your server has the vulnerabilities in Direct File Inclusion before they start the User Agent Attacks. They test if including the local file can review your website's environment variables, e.g. adding the following into your URL to review linux username and passwords: ../../../../etc/passwd. If this is successfuly, they can use User Agent to start attacking your server by downloading shell codes into your website.
