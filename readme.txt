= Does the plugin block User Agent attacks? =

= What is DFI or LFI? =
* DFI or LFI refers to Direct (Local) File Inclusion, where it usually comes with the user agent attacks. Hackers first test if your server has the vulnerabilities in Direct File Inclusion before they start the User Agent Attacks. They test if including the local file can review your website's environment variables, e.g. adding the following into your URL to review linux username and passwords: ../../../../etc/passwd. If this is successfuly, they can use User Agent to start attacking your server by downloading shell codes into your website.
